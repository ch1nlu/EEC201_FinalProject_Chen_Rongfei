# EEC201 Final Project: Speaker Recognition System
**Winter 2020 By Chen Lu and Rongfei Li**

## Ojectives ##
Our main goal is to build an automatic speaker recognition system with MATLAB as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program. On top of that, to carry out exhaustive expreriments to test and analyze the performance of the speaker recognition system.
